### Support your network

#### Use the active networks

- write readable and reader-friendly posts, add a picture and hashtags
- comment on other users’ posts

- follow users
- create a group and invite members
- help make your network a pleasant and interesting place for you and your friends

#### Liven up your network

If you are a member of a network, you want to meet interesting people there.
With more users, your network will become dynamic and diverse.
