### What it’s about

We are now launching our first crowdfunding campaign for all users of *ocelot.social* networks and for anyone interested in promoting independent social networks.

We are starting with a feature that ensures that important information remains more visible in groups.

### Pinning posts in groups

The goal is to allow group administrators to pin posts to the top of their group’s post list,
so that members can see these announcements immediately.
This feature already exists for the general post list.
To make it available for groups, this feature needs to be significantly expanded and programmatic tests need to be added for quality assurance.

### Why a crowdfunding?

busFaktor() e.V., the organization behind the free open-source software *ocelot.social*, is a non-profit.
Since it has no commercial interests, the further development of the software is financed solely through volunteer work, donations, membership fees, and contracts from the operators of *ocelot.social* networks to freelance developers.
This includes donations from you.
