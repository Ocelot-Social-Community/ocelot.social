## What is it about?

[**Utopia**](https://utopia-map.org/) and [**Ocelot**](https://ocelot.social/en/) are two free open source projects maintained and developed by [**busFaktor()**](https://www.busfaktor.org/de) and [**IT4Change**](https://it4c.dev/).
Both projects have similar goals: they want to bring people together and get them involved in social change.

Although both require largely the same components and services, these have not been shared with each other so far. Improvements to one project do not benefit the other project. In addition, they compete for the same developers.
Different tech stacks make it difficult to exploit synergies.

In this presentation, we want to highlight the similarities, look at how we can exploit synergies, and use our available resources effectively to achieve our common goals.
This will be followed by a joint discussion on the topic.

We look forward to your participation.
