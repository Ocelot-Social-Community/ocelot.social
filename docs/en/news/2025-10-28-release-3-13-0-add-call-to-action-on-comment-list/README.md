The new version 3.13.0 makes it easier for you to enable commenting.

## What is it about?

In some cases, the comment function is disabled for posts:

- If you have blocked the author of the post.
- If you are not a member of the group in which the post appears.

Previously, you only received a brief notification about this.

Now, with the new version of the *ocelot.social* software, you can click a button to unblock the author on their profile or join the group directly.

<figure class="blog-post-image">
  <img src="/blog/post-view-action-enter-group--de.png" alt="Action to join the group" />
  <figcaption class="blog-post-image-capture">
    Action to join the group.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

In addition, several technical improvements were made to the software and bugs were fixed.

For details see this [change log](https://github.com/Ocelot-Social-Community/Ocelot-Social/releases/tag/3.13.0).
