## What is it about?

For quite some time now, there has been a question as to whether [**ocelot.social**](https://ocelot.social/de/) can be connected to other apps via a shared login.

This feature makes it easier to use the [**Utopia Map**](https://utopia-map.org/) as a map in [**ocelot.social**](https://ocelot.social/de/), for example, and thus connect both projects.  
It is also needed to offer [**ocelot.social**](https://ocelot.social/de/) for NextCloud and perhaps other collaboration platforms, thereby significantly increasing the range of possible applications and thus the breadth of use.  
Several other arguments for implementing SSO have been raised over time.

We look forward to your participation.
